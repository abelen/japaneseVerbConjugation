# japaneseVerbConjugation
A small Java program that conjugates a Japanese verb that the user inputs. The user inputs the word either in 
kanji, along with its ending hiragana. Subsequently, the different conjugations of the word will appear in the GUI out to 
the user.
Current forms that are supported: Masu, Past, Te, Negative, Past Negative, Passive, Causative, Want To and Conditional.
More forms and romaji functionality to be added soon! ~Oresama
